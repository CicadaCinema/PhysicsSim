PhysicsSim is a customisable simulation of gravitational interactions between 'planets' depicted on a 2D plane. The simulation is controlled via a series of shortcut keys (these are remappable with a config file) and the cursor. It uses object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques to remain efficient, despite having O(n^2) complexity. It runs at a fixed time step (60 Hz) and doesn't slow down even with a large number of planets on a modern processor. The simulation itself was constructed with care to improve efficiency and readability of the code, but no optimisation is done on the gravitational calculation itself

### OOP
A major component of the design of the simulator is object-oriented programming (OOP). The fact that the simulation concerns an arbitrary number of discrete objects ('planets') makes it easy to conceptualise each planet as an instance of the planet class, with its own properties such as mass, size, location and velocity. Furthermore, each object must be able to update its location and velocity on every rendered frame, so it was intuitive to introduce a method of that class to handle updating these fields for a given planet. The principles of OOP allow each instance of this class to access data of all other instances, so that any given planet can calculate the force from all the other individual planets. OOP is also used elsewhere in the simulation, for example to differentiate between the two available modes: the idle mode and a mode for planet creation. Each one is a class, inherited by the XXX_REPLACE interface, which allows the swapping out of these classes inside a "current mode" variable. Both have an Update() method (as per the interface they inherit), allowing only certain actions to be performed in each mode, without a lengthy if else statement to determine the current mode, which would have to be run every frame.
